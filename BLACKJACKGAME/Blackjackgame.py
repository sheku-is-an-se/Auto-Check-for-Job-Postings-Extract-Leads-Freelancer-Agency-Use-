Creating a Card Class with outside variablesÂ¶
Here we will use some outside variables that we know don't change regardless of the situation, such as a deck of cards. Regardless of what round,match, or game we're playing, we'll still need the same deck of cards

    def __init__(self,suit,rank):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank
        self.value = values[rank]

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.suit == other.suit and self.rank == other.rank
