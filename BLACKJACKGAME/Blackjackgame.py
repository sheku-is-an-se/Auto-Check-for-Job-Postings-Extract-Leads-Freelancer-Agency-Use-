Creating a Card Class with outside variablesÂ¶
Here we will use some outside variables that we know don't change regardless of the situation, such as a deck of cards. Regardless of what round,match, or game we're playing, we'll still need the same deck of cards

'''
Methods:(DECK CLASS)
__init__(self): The constructor method to initialize the deck. This method should create all 52 cards and add them to the cards attribute.
shuffle(self): A method to shuffle the cards in the deck randomly.
deal_card(self): A method to remove and return the top card from the deck.
cards_left(self): A method to return the number of cards remaining in the deck.
__str__(self): A method to provide a string representation of the deck (optional).
